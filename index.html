				<p>The image featured here of Chadwick Boseman was taken days before the release of <em>Black Panther</em> in theaters. This is the image of a man fighting a private battle with colon cancer while upholding the mantle of many black icons with compassion, grace, and dignity. In so doing, he helped pave the way for his people to follow.</p>
				<p>Durring his private battle with colon cancer, Chadwick visited and inspired many children fighting their own battles with cancer, keeping in touch with many of them. Chadwick was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. On Friday, August 28, 2020, he passed away. May his legacy light the way for years to come. Rest in Power.</p>
